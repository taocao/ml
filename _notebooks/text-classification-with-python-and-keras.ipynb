Extracting features from text files\n\nIn order to perform machine learning on text documents, we first need to turn the text content into numerical feature vectors.\n\nBags of words\nThe most intuitive way to do so is to use a bags of words representation:\n\nAssign a fixed integer id to each word occurring in any document of the training set (for instance by building a dictionary from words to integer indices).\n\n## Tokenizing text with scikit-learn¶\nText preprocessing, tokenizing and filtering of stopwords are all included in CountVectorizer, which builds a \ndictionary of features and transforms documents to feature vectors\n#  The bags of words representation implies that n_features is the number of distinct words in the corpus: this number is typically larger than 100,000.\n\n# If n_samples == 10000, storing X as a NumPy array of type float32 would require 10000 x 100000 x 4 bytes = 4GB in RAM which is barely manageable on today’s computers.\n\nFortunately, most values in X will be zeros since for a given document less than a few thousand distinct words will be used. For this reason we say that bags of words are typically high-dimensional sparse datasets. We can save a lot of memory by only storing the non-zero parts of the feature vectors in memory.\n\nscipy.sparse matrices are data structures that do exactly this, and scikit-learn has built-in support for these structures.\n\n# From occurrences to frequencies¶\nOccurrence count is a good start but there is an issue: longer documents will have higher average count values than shorter documents, even though they might talk about the same topics.\n\nTo avoid these potential discrepancies it suffices to divide the number of occurrences of each word in a document by the total number of words in the document: these new features are called tf for Term Frequencies.\n\nAnother refinement on top of tf is to downscale weights for words that occur in many documents in the corpus and are therefore less informative than those that occur only in a smaller portion of the corpus.\n\nThis downscaling is called tf–idf for “Term Frequency times Inverse Document Frequency”.\n\nBoth tf and tf–idf can be computed as follows using TfidfTransformer:","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Defining a Baseline Model","metadata":{"_uuid":"884e3028489cb93b5e510f520dd927b2307d0efd"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"First, you are going to split the data into a training and testing set which will allow you to evaluate the accuracy and see if your model generalizes well.

You want to avoid overfitting, as this would mean that the model mostly just memorized the training data. This would account for a large accuracy with the training data but a low accuracy in the testing data.

Those parameters are called hyperparameters. This is the most time consuming part of machine learning and sadly there are no one-fits-all solutions ready.\n\nOne popular method for hyperparameter optimization is **grid search**. What this method does is it takes lists of parameters and it runs the model with each parameter combination that it can find. It is the most thorough way but also the most computationally heavy way to do this. Another common way,**random search**, which you’ll see in action here, simply takes random combinations of parameters.\n\nIn order to apply random search with Keras, you will need to use the KerasClassifier which serves as a wrapper for the scikit-learn API. With this wrapper you are able to use the various tools available with scikit-learn like cross-validation. The class that you need is RandomizedSearchCV which implements random search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is a way to validate the model and take the whole data set and separate it into multiple testing and training data sets.\n\nThere are various types of cross-validation. One type is the k-fold cross-validation. In this type the data set is partitioned into k equal sized sets where one set is used for testing and the rest of the partitions are used for training. This enables you to run k different runs, where each partition is once used as a testing set. So, the higher k is the more accurate the model evaluation is, but the smaller each testing set is.","metadata":{"_uuid":"985360d558b0fcd6b6f17bd8f7599a091b5aa35c"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"def create_model(num_filters, kernel_size, vocab_size, embedding_dim, maxlen):\n    model = Sequential()\n    model.add(layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=maxlen))\n    model.add(layers.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size, activation='relu'))\n    model.add(layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D())\n    model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))\n    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n    model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n                  loss='binary_crossentropy',\n                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n    return model","metadata":{"_uuid":"b347dfa060395fafe259a56d4bf4385d213a6727","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.276225Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.276801Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n                  kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n                  vocab_size=[5000], \n                  embedding_dim=[50],\n                  maxlen=[100])","metadata":{"_uuid":"cbdba00bf86fe148d34f58051aa8b74aa410894f","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.277589Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.278057Z"},"trusted":true},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":"# Main settings\nepochs = 20\nembedding_dim = 50\nmaxlen = 100\noutput_file = 'output.txt'\n\n# Run grid search for each source (yelp, amazon, imdb)\nfor source, frame in df.groupby('source'):\n    print('Running grid search for data set :', source)\n    sentences = df['sentence'].values\n    y = df['label'].values\n\n    # Train-test split\n    sentences_train, sentences_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n        sentences, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=1000)\n\n    # Tokenize words\n    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=5000)\n    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences_train)\n    X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_train)\n    X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_test)\n\n    # Adding 1 because of reserved 0 index\n    vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n\n    # Pad sequences with zeros\n    X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n    X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n\n    # Parameter grid for grid search\n    param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n                      kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n                      vocab_size=[vocab_size],\n                      embedding_dim=[embedding_dim],\n                      maxlen=[maxlen])\n    model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model,\n                            epochs=epochs, batch_size=10,\n                            verbose=False)\n    grid = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=model, param_distributions=param_grid,\n                              cv=4, verbose=1, n_iter=5)\n    grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train)\n\n    # Evaluate testing set\n    test_accuracy = grid.score(X_test, y_test)\n\n    # Save and evaluate results\n#     prompt = input(f'finished {source}; write to file and proceed?

Those parameters are called hyperparameters. This is the most time consuming part of machine learning and sadly there are no one-fits-all solutions ready.\n","\n","One popular method for hyperparameter optimization is **grid search**. What this method does is it takes lists of parameters and it runs the model with each parameter combination that it can find. It is the most thorough way but also the most computationally heavy way to do this. Another common way,**random search**, which you’ll see in action here, simply takes random combinations of parameters.\n","\n","In order to apply random search with Keras, you will need to use the KerasClassifier which serves as a wrapper for the scikit-learn API. With this wrapper you are able to use the various tools available with scikit-learn like cross-validation. The class that you need is RandomizedSearchCV which implements random search with cross-validation. Cross-validation is a way to validate the model and take the whole data set and separate it into multiple testing and training data sets.\n","\n","There are various types of cross-validation. One type is the k-fold cross-validation. In this type the data set is partitioned into k equal sized sets where one set is used for testing and the rest of the partitions are used for training. This enables you to run k different runs, where each partition is once used as a testing set. So, the higher k is the more accurate the model evaluation is, but the smaller each testing set is."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"b347dfa060395fafe259a56d4bf4385d213a6727","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.276225Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.276801Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["def create_model(num_filters, kernel_size, vocab_size, embedding_dim, maxlen):\n","    model = Sequential()\n","    model.add(layers.Embedding(vocab_size, embedding_dim, input_length=maxlen))\n","    model.add(layers.Conv1D(num_filters, kernel_size, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(layers.GlobalMaxPooling1D())\n","    model.add(layers.Dense(10, activation='relu'))\n","    model.add(layers.Dense(1, activation='sigmoid'))\n","    model.compile(optimizer='adam',\n","                  loss='binary_crossentropy',\n","                  metrics=['accuracy'])\n","    return model"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"cbdba00bf86fe148d34f58051aa8b74aa410894f","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.277589Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.278057Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n","                  kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n","                  vocab_size=[5000], \n","                  embedding_dim=[50],\n","                  maxlen=[100])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"_uuid":"a33d1066e49c58b8305208f5a59d220f7097bcb8","execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.278781Z","iopub.status.idle":"2022-06-01T21:45:17.279260Z"},"trusted":true},"outputs":[],"source":["# Main settings\n","epochs = 20\n","embedding_dim = 50\n","maxlen = 100\n","output_file = 'output.txt'\n","\n","# Run grid search for each source (yelp, amazon, imdb)\n","for source, frame in df.groupby('source'):\n","    print('Running grid search for data set :', source)\n","    sentences = df['sentence'].values\n","    y = df['label'].values\n","\n","    # Train-test split\n","    sentences_train, sentences_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(\n","        sentences, y, test_size=0.25, random_state=1000)\n","\n","    # Tokenize words\n","    tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=5000)\n","    tokenizer.fit_on_texts(sentences_train)\n","    X_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_train)\n","    X_test = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(sentences_test)\n","\n","    # Adding 1 because of reserved 0 index\n","    vocab_size = len(tokenizer.word_index) + 1\n","\n","    # Pad sequences with zeros\n","    X_train = pad_sequences(X_train, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n","    X_test = pad_sequences(X_test, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)\n","\n","    # Parameter grid for grid search\n","    param_grid = dict(num_filters=[32, 64, 128],\n","                      kernel_size=[3, 5, 7],\n","                      vocab_size=[vocab_size],\n","                      embedding_dim=[embedding_dim],\n","                      maxlen=[maxlen])\n","    model = KerasClassifier(build_fn=create_model,\n","                            epochs=epochs, batch_size=10,\n","                            verbose=False)\n","    grid = RandomizedSearchCV(estimator=model, param_distributions=param_grid,\n","                              cv=4, verbose=1, n_iter=5)\n","    grid_result = grid.fit(X_train, y_train)\n","\n","    # Evaluate testing set\n","    test_accuracy = grid.score(X_test, y_test)\n","\n","    # Save and evaluate results\n","#     prompt = input(f'finished {source}; write to file and proceed?

    "# Testing Machine Learning and MLOps Code\n",
    "> A tutorial to provide samples of tests for the most common operations in MLOps/Machine Learning projects. Testing the code used for MLOps or Machine Learning projects follows the same principles of any other software project.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Some scenarios might seem different or more difficult to test. The best way to approach this is to always have a test design session, where the focus is on the input/outputs, exceptions and testing the behavior of data transformations. Designing the tests first makes it easier to test as it forces a more modular style, where each function has one purpose, and extracting common functionality functions and modules.\n",

    "\n",
    "ML testing involves checks on model behaviour. Pre-train tests—which can be run without trained parameters—check if our written logic is correct. For example, is classification probability between 0 to 1? Post-train tests check if the learned logic is expected. For example, on the Titanic dataset, we should expect females to have a higher survival probability (relative to males).\n",
